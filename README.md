## 🍬 What is CandyHole?

CandyHole is an easy-to-use script designed to create a network tunnel using a tool called **paqet**. If you need to connect your device securely through another server or want to route your internet traffic differently, this script helps set that up quickly. You don’t need any programming skills to use it.

## 💻 System Requirements

Before you start, make sure your device meets these basic requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or later, macOS 10.13 or later, or Linux (Ubuntu 18.04+ recommended)
- **Internet Connection:** Required to download and run the program
- **Permissions:** Ability to run scripts or executables on your device
- **Storage:** At least 50 MB free space for the script and any temporary files
- **Software Needed:** You do not need to install paqet separately; the script handles it.

## 🚀 Getting Started

CandyHole works by running a script that sets up a tunnel automatically. Here’s how to start using it.

### Step 1: Preparing Your Computer

- **Windows Users:** You may need to allow the script to run by approving a security prompt.
- **macOS Users:** Depending on your security settings, you might have to allow the app to run in System Preferences under Security & Privacy.
- **Linux Users:** Ensure you have permission to execute scripts, which may require knowing your administrator password.

## 🔧 How CandyHole Works

CandyHole uses the paqet tool to create a network tunnel. This means it helps you send your internet traffic through another server. This can help:

- Secure your connection on public Wi-Fi
- Access websites or services restricted in your location
- Improve privacy by hiding your original IP address

After running the script, your internet is routed through a tunnel. This process starts automatically and does not require further input.

## ⚙️ Configuration and Options

CandyHole is mainly designed to work right out of the box. However, if you want to tweak settings:

- Open the script file in a text editor (Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on macOS).
- Look for a section labeled “Settings” or “Configuration.”
- You can change server addresses, ports, or logging options here.

If you are unsure about these changes, it is best to leave them as is.

## 📊 Checking the Connection

Once the tunnel is active, you can verify it is working by:

- Visiting a website that shows your IP address (search “What is my IP” in your browser).
- Check that the IP displayed matches the server location you expect.
- You should also notice improved connection stability when using restricted networks.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

If you run into issues, try these steps:

- Ensure you downloaded the correct file for your operating system.
- Check your internet connection is active.
- Make sure your security software or firewall is not blocking the script.
- Restart your computer and try running the script again.
- Run the script with administrator or root permissions if you get permission errors.
- Visit the GitHub Releases page to check if there is a newer version or known issues.

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

CandyHole tunnels your traffic securely, helping protect your data on unsafe networks. It does not collect personal information or logs your activity.
